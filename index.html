<h2><u>INTEREST IN IT</u>:</h2>
<p>“My interest in IT is primarily IT security (cybersecurity). My interest in IT started when I was a little kid (around the age of 7) when my parents got the family their very first desktop PC. I guess this event of my family getting their very first PC was when my interest in IT sparked, as from that point on, I was hooked onto using computers and technology. I have quite the background and experience in IT, in terms of primary and high school as I took every IT-related elective class in my high school years, as well as learning some IT in IT classes in primary school. Probably my most notable IT experience would be my experience doing a work experience program in the IT industry. I had completed a two-week work experience program at the head office of Officeworks. In this program I got the opportunity to work in various areas of the IT department, such as the helpdesk, the server room, and the repairs section. The completion of this work experience in the IT department in 2017 really made me consider not only studying IT in the future (todays present), but making me really consider an IT based and focused career for when I graduate.”</p>
<p>“I chose to come to RMIT because of many reasons. The first being the reputation. I had heard that RMIT is one of the best universities for studying technology-based subjects (as the word ‘technology’s even in its name!). So, I had made it a goal of mine to make it into RMIT after completing year 12. Another big factor which made me really want to study at RMIT was its location. Compared to some of the other universities out there, RMIT is fairly close to me – it’s about a 30-minute train ride. Location, to me is a really big factor when choosing a university, as it means I will not have to waste hours of my day taking transport, whereas I could be using that time for study! Also, a lot of my friends (mostly high school friends from year 12) were planning on going to go off to RMIT to study, so I had figured that choosing RMIT would be a smart decision as I would know a fair amount of people there, making my transition process from year 12 to university easier, as I could ask my fellow peers for guidance and help from time to time.”</p>

<h2><u>PROJECT IDEA</u>:</h2>
<h3><u>OVERVIEW</u>:</h3>
<p>This project will be the development of an iPhone application made to assist in the use of the Apple iPhone in new users.</p>
<br>
<h3><u>MOTIVATION</u>:</h3>
<p>iPhones are the most commonly used phone in Australia, and, within this population, more than 40% are above the age of 45, according to 2019 statistics. Inclusively, according to research, most iPhone users who use their phones that are above 45 don’t know how to perform simple tasks such as check their emails, or take slow-motion videos. </p>
<br>
<h3><u>DESCRIPTION</u>:</h3>
<p>‘Chatterbox’ is the name of a digital assistant, and also the name of a small application that’ll be made by Apple. It’ll be a free, downloadable application for Apple iPhones, and Chatterbox will help the user with the fundamentals and basics of using their iPhone, as it’ll most likely be their first time using an iPhone. The intended audience of Chatterbox will be people who are using an iPhone for the first time, and are unsure on how to do certain tasks with it. Chatterbox will come pre-installed on the user’s iPhone if during the setup process they select the ‘this is my first time using an iPhone’ checkbox. iPhone users will also be directed to where the Chatterbox app is on their iPhone, so they know where to go if they need assistance when using their phone. <br>
  <br>
  The main objective of the Chatterbox app is to keep things short, sweet and simple for the user, so that the new iPhone user will have no difficulties in using the app in finding the solution to their query. <br>
  <br>
  When the user opens the application for the first time, they’ll be shown a short one-minute video of how Chatterbox works, and how to use it. They’ll also be introduced to the assistant, ‘Chatterbox’ the chatterbot. Straightaway, when the induction video is finished, the app will send the user to the homepage of the Chatterbox app (the main screen). This homepage will be very simplistic in appearance as it’ll only include two buttons in the centre – a button with a microphone icon, and a button with a keyboard icon, giving the user two distinctly different ways of communicating their iPhone-related question across to Chatterbox. This obviously means that the user can choose whether to input their question via speech or typing. Once the user finishes inputting their query to Chatterbox whether it be by speech or typing, they’ll get a reply back from Chatterbox within a few seconds with an easy, detailed guide of how to go through with their basic query. Chatterbox’s reply will be delivered to the user in text (on their phone screen) and through audio (out of their speakers), to maximise the chances of the user understanding and comprehending Chatterbox’s instructions. <br>
  <br>
  The way Chatterbox is that it provides its users with answers from a database of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions); so, when the user inputs a question into Chatterbox, a query search will be performed in the database, and then the necessary information will be relayed back to the new iPhone. <br>
  <br>
  However, there will be unfortunate circumstances when Chatterbox will not know how to answer a specific question, so in this case, Chatterbox will be programmed to still search the database, but instead, pick up the most relevant and closest solutions to the user’s query, then presenting the user with a series of similar or close-enough solutions to their problem; and as Chatterbox is an application for only basic queries and questions, more advanced queries will be sent to and opened up in Siri, Chatterbox’s sister application. </p>
