<h1>RENELO ZAMMIT (s3842368) - ASSIGNMENT 1 - MY PROFILE</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
 
<h2>INTEREST IN IT</h2>
<p>“My interest in IT is primarily IT security (cybersecurity). My interest in IT started when I was a little kid (around the age of 7) when my parents got the family their very first desktop PC. I guess this event of my family getting their very first PC was when my interest in IT sparked, as from that point on, I was hooked onto using computers and technology. I have quite the background and experience in IT, in terms of primary and high school as I took every IT-related elective class in my high school years, as well as learning some IT in IT classes in primary school. Probably my most notable IT experience would be my experience doing a work experience program in the IT industry. I had completed a two-week work experience program at the head office of Officeworks. In this program I got the opportunity to work in various areas of the IT department, such as the helpdesk, the server room, and the repairs section. The completion of this work experience in the IT department in 2017 really made me consider not only studying IT in the future (todays present), but making me really consider an IT based and focused career for when I graduate.”
